			One way of defining your company's voice is by defining your company by one of Carl Jung’s 12 brand archetypes. The archetype for The Boba Factory is the Jester, who is all about having fun and thinking outside of the box. The sub architect to the jester that we connect the most to, is the entertainer. If you are unfamiliar with brand archetypes, two companies who personify the jester in their commercials are Geico and Old Spice. The people who connect most with the Jester are normally ages 16-30 and are turned off by serious things. They also want to stay on the cutting edge of communication and appreciate creativity in advertising. This fits the demographic of our target audience, but also the personality. College students prefer discussing serious topics, if they discuss them at all, in a joking matter, as seen by the “meme culture”. The jester fits our brand because serving a cup of boba from a vending machine is a very out of the box idea. An example of how our company would personify the jester is by having clever names for our drinks. We will also keep our advertisements and promotional videos lighthearted, full of jokes, and not too dense of information.
