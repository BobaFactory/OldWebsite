				We are The Boba Factory. We are desigining an automated machine that will provide you boba anywhere, anytime. We have three major problems that we are trying to solve. <br><br>
			<ul> 
				<li>Price:</li> <br><br>
				<li>This is why the biggest problem with the boba tea industry is the price. People can get a dollar cup of coffee from McDonalds, but a cup of boba tea costs 4 dollars on average, can end upwards of 5. This exceeds the college budget and prevents people from becoming regulars.</li> <br><br>
				<li>Convience:</li> <br> <br>
				<li>It is also inconvenient to get boba. You canâ€™t really use it as a study drink because only a few places stay open late, and the boba during closing hours is never fresh. And even if you make it to the shops during these inconvenient times, there are long lines because they are the few convenient times.</li> <br> <br>
				<li>Bad Boba:</li> <br> <br>
				<li>And the worst is when you get a bad cup of boba. Not having chewy and soft boba can ruin the entire experience and we are striving to brew our boba fresh for every cup we serve.</li> <br> <br>
