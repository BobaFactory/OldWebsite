			From our current research and market analysis, we've come to the conclusion that college students are our target market. Size of UT Market
			The size of the market at UT was based on average pricing of drinks at boba shops near UT, the Popular Times data on Google, and personal data collection at boba shops near UT. By obtaining the data for how many people bought boba in one and a half hours at Tapioca House and GongCha in person, we used the Popular Times on Google data, matching the hour that we went to a popularity, and then extrapolating the sales from it. Then using each store price for a cup of milk tea, we were able to figure out a dollar amount of yearly sales. We followed the same process for the rest of the shops are campus, as well as documenting the amount of sales made in the 2 hours before closing for each shop. Then we predicted what percentage of each companies sales we believed we would be able to steal from them. For all shops, we believe we could take twenty percent of the sales that happen in the last two hours of the shop being open because of our competitive advantage. For each individual shop, we came up with a percentage of their day sales we could win, averaging about 12 percent of sales from each shop. Combining this with our price per cup of boba, we came up with $276,000 in yearly sales.
