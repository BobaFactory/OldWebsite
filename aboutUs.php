				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>We are The Boba Factory. We are desigining an automated machine that will provide you boba anywhere, anytime. We have three major problems that we are trying to solve.</strong></p>
				<h4>Price</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">This is why the biggest problem with the boba tea industry is the price. People can get a dollar cup of coffee from McDonalds, but a cup of boba tea costs 4 dollars on average, can end upwards of 5. This exceeds the college budget and prevents people from becoming regulars.</p>
				<h4>Convenience</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">It is also inconvenient to get boba. You can’t really use it as a study drink because only a few places stay open late, and the boba during closing hours is never fresh. And even if you make it to the shops during these inconvenient times, there are long lines because they are the few convenient times.</p>
				<h4>No Bad Boba</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">And the worst is when you get a bad cup of boba. Not having chewy and soft boba can ruin the entire experience and we are striving to brew our boba fresh for every cup we serve.</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify;">From our current research and market analysis, we've come to the conclusion that college students are our target market. Size of UT Market The size of the market at UT was based on average pricing of drinks at boba shops near UT, the Popular Times data on Google, and personal data collection at boba shops near UT. By obtaining the data for how many people bought boba in one and a half hours at Tapioca House and GongCha in person, we used the Popular Times on Google data, matching the hour that we went to a popularity, and then extrapolating the sales from it. Then using each store price for a cup of milk tea, we were able to figure out a dollar amount of yearly sales. We followed the same process for the rest of the shops are campus, as well as documenting the amount of sales made in the 2 hours before closing for each shop. Then we predicted what percentage of each companies sales we believed we would be able to steal from them. For all shops, we believe we could take twenty percent of the sales that happen in the last two hours of the shop being open because of our competitive advantage. For each individual shop, we came up with a percentage of their day sales we could win, averaging about 12 percent of sales from each shop. Combining this with our price per cup of boba, we came up with $276,000 in yearly sales.</p>

				<h2>Experience</h2>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">One way of defining your company's voice is by defining your company by one of Carl Jung’s 12 brand archetypes. The archetype for The Boba Factory is the Jester, who is all about having fun and thinking outside of the box. The sub architect to the jester that we connect the most to, is the entertainer. If you are unfamiliar with brand archetypes, two companies who personify the jester in their commercials are Geico and Old Spice. The people who connect most with the Jester are normally ages 16-30 and are turned off by serious things. They also want to stay on the cutting edge of communication and appreciate creativity in advertising. This fits the demographic of our target audience, but also the personality. College students prefer discussing serious topics, if they discuss them at all, in a joking matter, as seen by the “meme culture”. The jester fits our brand because serving a cup of boba from a vending machine is a very out of the box idea. An example of how our company would personify the jester is by having clever names for our drinks. We will also keep our advertisements and promotional videos lighthearted, full of jokes, and not too dense of information.</p>
